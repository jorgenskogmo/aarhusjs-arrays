      So,
      <br /><br />

      Some of you might remember me from Aarhus JS at Whiteaway Group on December 7th, 2020<br />
      where we looked at the <span class="code">Canvas</span> element - and hopefully inspired you to go deeper with
      graphics programming.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-frWD3AS-0g">the youtube video</a>

      <br /><br />
      In hindsight, the <span class="code">Canvas</span> exploration took us down a path towards technologies (like
      shaders, graphics cards, vector math) that's not usually in the realm of most javascript developers,

      <br /><br />
      Today, I hope we can do the same (!) with <span class="code">Array</span>s (!!)

      <br /><br />
      Lets continue where we left off - a <span class="code">Canvas</span> example

    OK, now

    <h1>Arrays! and how "Great Ux starts with great data"</h1>

    (sorry Anders, the “Great Ux starts with great data” was just a pun on <em>your</em> title, hope you're ok with
    that
    ... )


    <div class="prose">
      <pre>

Lets have a look at

- how to use it
- what makes it fast
- how low-level arrays work (C, C++, Obj-C, Rust, Swift)
- how js arrays work (with a peek at TurboFan)

- work with binary data (web-ble example)
- work with buffers (sound example)

</pre>
    </div>

    <span class="code">But, there's something about that title -
      planning for <strong>performance</strong> does involve data - as we will see.</span>
