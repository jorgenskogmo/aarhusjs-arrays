So, 

Arrays!

We will look at this fundamental data structure to understand how to
- use it
- what makes it fast
- how low-level arrays work (C, C++, Obj-C, Rust, Swift)
- how js arrays work (with a peek at TurboFan)
- work with binary data (web-ble example)
- work with batch updates (canvas2d example)
- work with buffers (sound example)

and finally, what arrays of data brings in regards to performance optimisation,
which makes users happy
(sorry Søren, the “Great Ux starts with great data” was just an evil pun on your title, hope you’re ok with that ... )

      document.querySelectorAll(".prose > pre").forEach( el => {
        el.parentNode.innerHTML = el.innerText.split("\n").join("<br />\n")
      })
