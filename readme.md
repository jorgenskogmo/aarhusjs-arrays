> Great UX starts with great data ;-)

we're taking another look at how understanding the web-platform
enables not only development of better experiences on the web,
but also opens other "scriptable" environments for creative exploration.

Last time, we looked at how the `<canvas>` element was a portal into computational graphics,
3D and now GPU programming;
this time, we'll look at the `array` datastructure.

New to none, but there should be sth in here for us all.
